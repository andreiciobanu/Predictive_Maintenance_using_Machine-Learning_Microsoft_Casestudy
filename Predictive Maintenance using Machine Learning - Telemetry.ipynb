The recommend Azure Machine Learning Studio experiment can be found in the Cortana Intelligence Gallery: Predictive Maintenance Modelling Guide Experiment. Below, we describe the modelling process and provide an example Python model.\n","\n","# Training, Validation and Testing\n","When working with time-stamped data as in this example, record partitioning into training, validation, and test sets should be performed carefully to prevent overestimating the performance of the models. In predictive maintenance, the features are usually generated using lagging aggregates: records in the same time window will likely have identical labels and similar feature values. These correlations can give a model an \"unfair advantage\" when predicting on a test set record that shares its time window with a training set record. We therefore partition records into training, validation, and test sets in large chunks, to minimize the number of time intervals shared between them.\n","\n","Predictive models have no advance knowledge of future chronological trends: in practice, such trends are likely to exist and to adversely impact the model's performance. To obtain an accurate assessment of a predictive model's performance, we recommend training on older records and validating/testing using newer records.\n","\n","For both of these reasons, a time-dependent record splitting strategy is an excellent choice for predictive maintenace models. The split is effected by choosing a point in time based on the desired size of the training and test sets: all records before the timepoint are used for training the model, and all remaining records are used for testing. (If desired, the timeline could be further divided to create validation sets for parameter selection.) To prevent any records in the training set from sharing time windows with the records in the test set, we remove any records at the boundary -- in this case, by ignoring 24 hours' worth of data prior to the timepoint."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier\n","\n","    # make test and training splits\n","    threshold_dates = [[pd.to_datetime('2015-07-31 01:00:00'), pd.to_datetime('2015-08-01 01:00:00')],\n","                    [pd.to_datetime('2015-08-31 01:00:00'), pd.to_datetime('2015-09-01 01:00:00')],\n","                    [pd.to_datetime('2015-09-30 01:00:00'), pd.to_datetime('2015-10-01 01:00:00')]]\n","\n","    test_results = []\n","    models = []\n","    for last_train_date, first_test_date in threshold_dates:\n","        # split out training and test data\n","        train_y = labeled_features.loc[labeled_features['datetime'] < last_train_date, 'failure']\n","        train_X = pd.get_dummies(labeled_features.loc[labeled_features['datetime'] < last_train_date].drop(['datetime',\n","                                                                                                            'machineID',\n","                                                                                                            'failure'], 1))\n","        test_X = pd.get_dummies(labeled_features.loc[labeled_features['datetime'] > first_test_date].drop(['datetime',\n","                                                                                                        'machineID',\n","                                                                                                        'failure'], 1))\n","        # train and predict using the model, storing results for later\n","        my_model = GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=42)\n","        my_model.fit(train_X, train_y)\n","        test_result = pd.DataFrame(labeled_features.loc[labeled_features['datetime'] > first_test_date])\n","        test_result['predicted_failure'] = my_model.predict(test_X)\n","        test_results.append(test_result)\n","        models.append(my_model)"],"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"gather":{"logged":1598814242717}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["sns.set_style(\"darkgrid\")\n","plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n","labels, importances = zip(*sorted(zip(test_X.columns, models[0].feature_importances_), reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[1]))\n","plt.xticks(range(len(labels)), labels)\n","_, labels = plt.xticks()\n","plt.setp(labels, rotation=90)\n","plt.bar(range(len(importances)), importances)\n","plt.ylabel('Importance')"],"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"gather":{"logged":1598820900689}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Evaluation\n","In predictive maintenance, machine failures are usually rare occurrences in the lifetime of the assets compared to normal operation.
